# Image-segmentation

## Project name
ROI Selection and Classical Image Segmentation with Comparative Analysis

Mu Li
## What the project does
Implement four classical segmentation algorithums: Otsu Thresholding, K-Means Algorithum, Contour Detection, and Watershed Algorithum. 
Using these algorithums, user can select a Region of Interest (ROI) or multiple ROIs of a sample image by drawing a rectangle with the mouse on the image. 


## How to install requirements 
Install with `pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-contrib-python`

## How to run the code 
1. input the path of image (manually)
2. run
3. choose ROIs, enter "space" to confirm, enter "Esc" to exit
4. get results

## Example screenshoots or figures 
Using K-Means Algorithum as an example:

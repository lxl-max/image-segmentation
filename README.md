# Image-segmentation

## Project name
ROI Selection and Classical Image Segmentation with Comparative Analysis

Mu Li
## What the project does
Implement four classical segmentation algorithums: Otsu Thresholding, K-Means Algorithum, Contour Detection, and Watershed Algorithum. 
Using these algorithums, user can select a Region of Interest (ROI) or multiple ROIs by drawing a rectangle (or polygon) with the mouse on the image. 


## How to install requirements
